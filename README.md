# Routed-React-Isomorphic-and-Hot
A simple development setup using ReactJS with Routing, Hot-loading and Isomorphic rendering.

This is my first gitHub repo, so be nice and don't hesitate to help me around.

# Why this repo.
I've created this package during learning about ReactJS and Isomorphic rendering. 
There are a bunch of tutorials out there, but none of them showed me a simple Isomorphic rendering, using the React Router.

You can use this package if you want a setup for ReactJS that includes the Router, Webpack Hot-loading and serverside isomorphic rendering.

# Installation.
To use development mode, command `npm run dev` to kickstart Webpack with hot-loading. Go to: http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/#/

To use production mode, command `npm start` to let Webpack render a production bundle, and Node with start rendering your ReactJS app. Go to http://localhost:3000/

# Sharing is caring.
All feedback is welcome.
